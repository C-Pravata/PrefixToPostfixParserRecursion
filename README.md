# Prefix to Postfix Converter

This program reads an input file that contains prefix expressions and converts them to postfix expressions using a recursive method. The program then writes the resulting postfix expressions to an output file. The program checks for errors such as invalid expressions, insufficient operands, and the use of spaces in the expressions.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you need Python 3 installed on your computer.  You also need to have the input file(s) with prefix expressions to be converted to postfix.

## How to Use

1.  Open the command prompt or terminal.
2.  Navigate to the directory where the program file is saved.
3.  Run the program by typing the following command:  `python prefix_to_postfix_converter.py`
4.  The program will read the input file(s), convert the prefix expressions to postfix expressions, and write the results to the output file(s).
5.  If there are errors in the input file(s), the program will write an error message to the output file(s).

## Input File Format

Each input file should contain one prefix expression per line. The expressions should only contain operators and operands, with no spaces. The allowed operators are  `+`,  `-`,  `*`,  `/`,  `$`, and  `^`. The allowed operands are any alphanumeric characters. Here is an example of a valid input file:

```
+AB
*CDE
$FGH

```

## Output

The program writes the resulting postfix expression for each line of the input file(s) to the output file(s). If there are errors in the input file(s), the program writes an error message to the output file(s) for each error encountered.

Note: The output file(s) will be created in the same directory as the program file.
